CANNOT TAKE OPPONENTS KING

REDUCE PSUEDOLEGAL MOVES SO THAT YOU ARE NOT IN CHECK AFTER THE MOVE

CREATE CONCEPT OF CHECK

Pseudo legal move gen
	knights, rooks, queens are all good :) i think
	
	pawn
	 - enPassant takes
	
	king
	 - king cannot take opponent piece if it is defended
	 - cannot be adjacent to opponent king
	 
	NO PEICE CAN TAKE THE OPPONENTS KING

Create a PGN
Read PGN - play a series of moves

Recursive function to calc number of moves at each depth
	
on move played
	Update half move count
	Update full move count
	Update FEN
	Update PGN

Create concept of checkmate - no moves after pseudo legal moves have been checked- the player wins (should be easy, hope i'm not wrong)

 if true: check if current tile is a valid move for that peice and the new tagert tile
