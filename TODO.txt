Pseudo legal move gen
	knights are all good :) i think
	
	pawn
	 - takes on diagonal
	
	bishop 
	 - refactor to loop through an array of unit vectors with a subloop defining magnitude
	 
	rook, king, queen
	 - all
	 - king cannot take opponent piece if it is defended
	 
	cannot take opponents king
	
Check if after the move is played your king is in check

Create a PGN

Read PGN - play a series of moves

on move played
	Update half move count
	Update full move count
	Update FEN
	Update PGN

Create concept of checkmate - no moves after pseudo legal moves have been checked- the player wins (should be easy, hope i'm not wrong)
