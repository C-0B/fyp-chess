Pseudo legal move gen
	knights, rooks, queens are all good :) i think
	
	pawn
	 - takes on diagonal
	 - enPassant takes
	
	bishop 
	 - refactor to loop through an array of unit vectors with a subloop defining magnitude
	 
	king
	 - all
	 - king cannot take opponent piece if it is defended
	 
	cannot take opponents king
	
	
Recursive function to calc number of moves at each depth
	
Check if after the move is played your king is in check

Create a PGN

Read PGN - play a series of moves

on move played
	Update half move count
	Update full move count
	Update FEN
	Update PGN

Create concept of checkmate - no moves after pseudo legal moves have been checked- the player wins (should be easy, hope i'm not wrong)
