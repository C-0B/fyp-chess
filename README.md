# Algorithms and Techniques to Create and Play the Game of Chess

This project covers the various techniques and algorithms that have been implemented into creating chess
in a computer and getting computers to play games of chess. A Java application has been developed
where users can play chess in a solo game or against computer controlled opponents. These opponents
each use different methods to select the move that they will play and have been tested against each other
to determine each strength’s, weaknesses and overall performance.
This project was not undertook with aspirations to become the world’s next greatest chess engine, but
to cover some of the fundamentals of computer chess and begin to look at the methods used to enable
computers to perform tasks that are impossible for humans, such as large calculations involved in playing
games of chess.
